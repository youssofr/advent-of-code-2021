# Description

This is a copmlete solution to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) written in Python, C++, and JavaScript.

The solutions are split into directories by the programming language used, each directory has a helper module that contains functions that aim to reduce the
redundant aspects of solving the puzzles and help make the code cleaner and more understandable. 

Every directory contains a requirements file to help you prepare your system to successfully run the code.

The test directory contains a system utility which can run the three from the same platform and compare their performance.

__P.S.:__ this README is currently more of a checklist for me to complete rather than an actual description of project.
