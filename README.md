# Description

I am taking the opportunity to participate in [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)
to pracitce, not only problem solving skills, but also some of the software engineering skills I would like to develop further.

Hence, I paid some care to modularizing my code into reusable modules. And tried to add some fancy functionalities that can help me focus more on the problems solving aspect of the challenges once I have written helper code.

I will solve the problems in language I currently use, want to refresh my knowledge of, or would like to learn. They are, respectively, Python, C++, and Javascript.

I will create a system utility which can run the three from the same platform and compare their performance.
